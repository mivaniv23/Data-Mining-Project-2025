# Data Mining Final Project Spring 2025

## Name and Introduction:

## Overview
This project follows the CRISP-DM process for a supervised learning task.

## Problem Statement
Problem:
* The problem is to predict the winner of an ATP tennis match based on various features such as tournament, date, surface type, player statistics, and round. This is a classification problem where the goal is to determine which player will win based on historical match data.

Justification:
* Predicting match outcomes is valuable for a variety of reasons, including improving the accuracy of sports betting models, analyzing player performance, and aiding coaches and analysts in match preparations. With the dataset spanning a long period (2000-2025), it provides enough historical data to build predictive models that can capture trends and patterns in match outcomes.
